## Getting Started
1. User is able to log and in view events that they have created 
2. When clicking on the new event button a form is rendered with two fields, one for the title of the event and the other is for uploading a template with a column of names and a column of phone numbers 
3. After the form is submitted all the guests on the list will recieve a text message with a unique url that directs them to a qr code generated for them to check in at an event 
4. Full CRUD is avaible for a User to work with both the event model and the event list model
